Act actions should be as atomic and \n      specific as possible, i.e. \"Click the sign in button\" or \"Type 'hello' into the search input\". \n      AVOID actions that are more than one step, i.e. \"Order me pizza\" or \"Send an email to Paul \n      asking him to call me\". \nstagehand_extract: Extracts all of the text from the current page.\nstagehand_observe: Observes elements on the web page. Use this tool to observe elements that you can later use in an action. Use observe instead of extract when dealing with actionable (interactable) elements rather than text. More often than not, you'll want to use extract instead of observe when dealing with scraping or extracting structured text.\nscreenshot: Takes a screenshot of the current page. Use this tool to learn where you are on the page when controlling the browser with Stagehand. Only use this tool when the other tools are not sufficient to get the information you need.\n\nUse the following format:\n\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nAction: the action to take, should be one of [stagehand_navigate, stagehand_act, stagehand_extract, stagehand_observe, screenshot]\nAction Input: the input to the action\nObservation: the result of the action\n...
